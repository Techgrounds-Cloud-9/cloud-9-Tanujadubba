# Setting up

# Introduction

- Linux, like Windows or MacOS, is an operating system. It manages the communication between the physical device (hardware) and all computer programs (software).

- In Linux, the graphical user interface (GUI) is considered to be optional. You control it using a command line (CLI), typing in commands. It is important to get somewhat comfortable with the CLI. Although we will have a GUI, for now. That wonâ€™t always be the case.

# Exercise

- Make an SSH-connection to your machine. SSH requires the key file to have specific permissions, so you might need to change those.

- When the connection is successful, type whoami in the terminal. This command should show your username
