# Cronjobs
- A cron job is a Linux command used for scheduling tasks to be executed sometime in the future.
-  Cron is used to schedule commands at a specific time. These scheduled commands or tasks are known as "Cron Jobs"
- Cron is a daemon – a background process executing non-interactive jobs. In Windows, you might be familiar with background processes such as Services that work similarly to the cron daemon.
