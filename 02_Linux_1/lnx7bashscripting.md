# Bashscripting

- The default command line interface in Linux is called a Bash shell.
- A bash script is a series of commands written in a file. These are read and executed by the bash program.

**Shell**

- Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.

**Scripting**

- Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one.
