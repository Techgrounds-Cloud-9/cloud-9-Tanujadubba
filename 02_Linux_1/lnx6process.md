# Process

- Processes in Linux can be divided into three categories: Daemons, Services, and Programs.
A daemon runs in the background and is non-interactive. A Service responds to requests from programs. A service may be interactive.

**Telnet**

- Telnet is an old network protocol that is used to connect to remote systems over a TCP/IP network.

**Pid**

- A PID is an acronym for process identification number on a Linux or Unix-like operating system. A PID is automatically assigned to each process when it is created. A process is nothing but running instance of a program and each process has a unique PID on a Unix-like system.
