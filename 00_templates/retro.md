   ### Atalla
## What went well?
 - Good team spirit. Collaboration all the way even between members that study different Cloud Service Provider.

## What could have gone better?

- In general nothing. But maybe I would've liked to exchange more knowledge between Azure and AWS to get a wider scope of knowledge about the Cloud. But then again, that wasn't really feasible considering the extensive content and all the fuss with the accounts the Azure people had.


## What can we do to improve?

- I think organizing like daily short team meetings at the end of the day to exchange knowledge between Azure and AWS (if possible) can be an option


  ### Tanuja

- Dialy statdups on each day to know the progress of each other and team discusions either Azure/Aws 

### What could have gone better?

- If i manage my time while doing the theoritical exercises ,i would have spend more time on my practical exercises.


## What can we do to improve?
- By managing the time.
- Not to spend too much on one issue.
