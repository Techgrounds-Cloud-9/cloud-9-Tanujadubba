# Introduction
- A variable is a symbolic name for (or reference to) information. The     variable's name represents what information the variable contains. They are called variables because the represented information can change but the operations on the variable remain the same.

- A variable name must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_) Example: abc=100 #valid syntax.

- The first character can be followed by letters, numbers or underscores.

- Python variable names are case sensitive.

- Reserved words cannot be used as variable names.

**Top 4 Types of Variables in Python**

1. Integer: Numeric values.

2. Long Integer: A integer whose length is greater than a usual integer type variable.

3. Float: Variables that are intended to hold floating precession values.

4. String: Variables that are intended to hold a string of letters.
