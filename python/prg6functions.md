# Introduction

# Functions

- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

- A function can return data as a result.

- To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis.

# Key terminology

  - Parameter
  - Argument

- From a function's perspective:

- A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

- An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.


# Exercise 1:

- Create a new script.
- Import the random package.
- Print 5 random integers with a value between 0 and 100.

# Result

# Exercise 2:

- Create a new script.
- Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.
-	Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, <string>!”.


# Result
