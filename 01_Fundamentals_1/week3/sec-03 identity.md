# Identity and access Managment(IAM)

- Identity and access management make sure that the right people and job roles in your organization (identities) can access the tools they need to do their jobs.
- Iam is two types **Muti factor authentication** and **Privileged management**
# Keywords
+ Multifactor authentication
+ Privileged access management
+ Authentication
+ Authorization
+ Knowledge Factor
+ Possession Factor
+ Inheritance Factor

*The difference between authentication and authorization.*

- Simply put, one verifies the identity of a user or service before granting them access, while the other determines what they can do once they have access.

*The three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security.*

- Something you know/knowledge factor(such as a password)
- Something you have/Posession Factor (such as a smart card)
- Something you are/inheritance Factor(such as a fingerprint or other biometric method)
	
How does MFA Improve Security?

- MFA adds layers of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification.
- Using MFA is one of the most effective ways to prevent unauthorized access as it requires additional validation of login credentials during a userâ€™s authentication process. This can be as straightforward as a user providing their password, then entering an accompanying numeric code from an SMS text.

*Five reasons why to switch MFA*
- Increases security
- Safeguards user identity
- Protects from password theft casused by exposed passwords.
- Meets the regulatory requirments and complies with solution.
- Promotes easy implementation without compromising user experirnce.

*What the principle of least privilege is and how it improves security*

+ The principle of least privilege works by allowing only enough access to perform the required job. In    an IT environment, adhering to the principle of least privilege reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to critical systems or sensitive data by compromising a low-level user account, device, or application.
+By giving better security,Minimized attack surface,Limited malware propagation,better stability,Improved audit  readliness privilege factor will improve security.
