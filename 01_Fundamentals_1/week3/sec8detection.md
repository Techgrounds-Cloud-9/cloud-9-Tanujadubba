# Dtection,responce and analysis
- Threat detection is the practice of analyzing the entirety of a security ecosystem to identify any malicious activity that could compromise the network.

# Keywords
 # IDS
 - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system that detects suspicious activities and      generates alerts when they are detected. 

 # IPS

 - An intrusion prevention system (IPS) – sometimes referred to as an intrusion detection prevention system (IDPS) – is a network security technology and key part of any enterprise security system that continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and takes steps to prevent it.

 # RPO

 - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) generally refers to the amount of data that can be lost within a period most relevant to a business, before significant harm occurs, from the point of a critical event to the most preceding backup.

 # RTO

 -Recovery Time Objective (RTO) often refers to the quantity of time that an application, system and/or process, can be down for without causing significant damage to the business as well as the time spent restoring the application and its data.

 ## Hack response strategies.
  - the most popular techniques used by hackers are
      - Malware
      - Social engeneering
      - Credential compramise
      - DDos (Distributed Denial of Service)

 ## The concept of systems hardening.

   - Systems hardening is a collection of tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce vulnerability in technology applications, systems, infrastructure, firmware, and other areas. The goal of systems hardening is to reduce security risk by eliminating potential attack vector s and condensing the system's attack surface.
 
## Different types of disaster recovery options

  - Data center disaster recovery.
  -  Network disaster recovery.
  - Virtualized disaster recovery.
  - Cloud disaster recovery.
  - Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) 

# Overcomechallenges
 No overcome challenges,the concept is for us to understnd by studying.


# Exercise
- A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens using the most recent available backup. The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database, and the entire process takes about 15 minutes. What is the RPO of the database?

 - Ans: The Rpo of the database is 24 hrs.

- An automatic failover to a backup web server has been configured for a website. Because the backup has to be powered on first and has to pull the newest version of the website from GitHub, the process takes about 8 minutes. What is the RTO of the website?

- Ans: 8 minutes.
