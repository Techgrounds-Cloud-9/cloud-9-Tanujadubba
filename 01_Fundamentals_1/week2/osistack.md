** Advantages of osi model **
> The OSI model helps users and operators of computer networks:

Determine the required hardware and software to build their network.
Understand and communicate the process followed by components communicating across a network. 
Perform troubleshooting, by identifying which network layer is causing an issue and focusing efforts on that layer.
The OSI model helps network device manufacturers and networking software vendors
** Advantages of tcp/ip **
Good failure recovery.
The ability to add networks without interrupting existing services.
High error-rate handling.
Platform independence.
Low data overhead.
