Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F.
# Decimal
Decimal numbers make use of 10 symbols from 0 to 9 and its combinations to represent different values.
